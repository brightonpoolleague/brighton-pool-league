- If a winner declines a singles spot, then it will be passed down the list in
ranking order.

- If we reach the bottom of the list & have been unable to fill the singles spots,
we will start at the top of the list and offer it to the runners up / 2nd in the
averages.

- If runners up decline a singles spot & we reach the bottom of the list, we will

Brighton league) – they are currently under review, with more information to
follow at a later date.
