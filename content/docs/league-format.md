## 4. Completing the Score Sheet

a. The **home captain** writes their players’ full names against numbers **1–5** (running order in the first set).  
b. Fold the paper in half (to hide what has been written) and pass it to the **away captain**, who writes their players’ full names against **1–5** (their running order in the first set).  
c. Mark an **“X”** next to the player who will break first.  
d. The **home team’s playing order** remains the same for all sets.  
e. The **away team’s playing order** changes each set so that opponents always differ, as shown below:

f. Since substitutions are allowed in Sets 2 and 3, captains should not complete player names for the next set unless no substitutions are being made.  
g. You do not need to write players’ full names for each set they play — initials are fine, provided they are unique within the team.  
h. When introducing a substitute for the first time, write their **full name**.  
i. After each game, record the result with **W** or **L** (you do not need to write 1–0).  
j. Record each game that is won by a **dish** or **reverse dish**:
- A **dish** is a clearance in one visit from the break.
- A **reverse dish** occurs when your opponent fails to pot from the break (or foul breaks) and you clear up in one visit.

## 5. Substitutions

a. Before the 2nd and 3rd sets begin, captains may substitute as many players as they wish.  
b. Substitutes take the **same position** as the player they replace (e.g., if Player 1 is replaced in Set 3, the substitute plays second in that set).  
c. A player may be substituted out in Set 2 and substituted back in for Set 3.  
d. Substituted players must **not** have played in the previous set (to prevent simply changing the playing order).

---

## 6. Lagging

a. Only **Player 1** from each team lags — this determines the breaking order for the rest of the match.  
b. Breaks alternate between teams: the team that breaks first gets **8 breaks**, while their opponents get **7**.

---

## 7. End of the Match

a. Record the number of games each team has won at the bottom of the score sheet (the total should be **15**).  
b. The **winning captain** must take a clear photo of the completed sheet and either post it on Facebook or send it to the captains’ WhatsApp group **before 10:00 AM the following day**.
