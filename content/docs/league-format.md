# Guide to the change of format – effective 19th May 2025

## 1) Overview

a. All matches are 3 sets of 5 singles frame games (15 games in total).

b. Player substitutions are allowed before the start of the 2nd & 3rd set (up to 15 different
players can play in one match).

c. The same player can play in each of the 3 sets (maximum of 3 games)

d. The same player CAN NOT play multiple times in the same set i.e. play their 3 games in
set 1 and leave.

## 2) Time Keeping

a. Matches should start at 8pm sharp.

b. Captains are responsible for matches starting on time, maintaining the flow of the game
through each set, and ensuring the match finishes before 11pm.

c. Captains should allow a maximum of 1 hour per set, therefore if you haven’t started
your 3rd set by 10pm, both captains need to hurry their teams up.

d. Shot clocks are advised to be introduced at 10:30pm, if the 3rd game (in the 3rd set)
hasn’t yet started (link to shot clock is in the captains WhatsApp group)

## 3) Completing the score sheet

a. Home captain writes their players name down IN FULL against numbers 1 -5 (running
order in the first set).

b. Bend the paper in half (to hide what has been written) and pass to away captain to write
their names down in full across 1 - 5 (their running order in the first set).

c. Put a "x" next to the player whose turn it is to break.

d. Playing order doesn’t change for the home team in each set.

e. Playing order does change for the away team (so opponents always differ) as follows

f. As substitutions are allowed in sets 2 and 3, captains should not complete the player’s
names for the following set, unless it’s confirmed no substitutions are being made for
that set.

g. You don’t need to write the players down in full for each set they play, you can enter
initials instead (but be aware if the same initials are used for another player in your
team).

h. When bringing on a substitute for the first time - write their name down in full.

i. Simply write W or L against each player’s name after each game (you don’t need to write
1 vs 0)

j. Record each game that is won by a dish or reverse dish (Dish is a clearance in 1 visit
from break, reverse dish is when your opponent fails to pot off break or foul breaks and
you clear up in 1 visit)

## 4) Substitutions

a. Before the 2nd & 3rd sets have started, captains can substitute as many players as they
want.

b. Substituted players will take on order of the player coming off (i.e. if player 1 is being
substituted in set 3, their replacement plays 2nd)

c. A Player can be substituted out, in set 2, and substituted back in for set 3.

d. Substituted players must NOT have played the previous set (as that’s simply changing
the playing order)

## 5) Lagging

a. ONLY Player 1 from each team lags – this sets the breaking order for the rest of the
match

b. Breaks alternate between teams, so the team who broke first get 8 breaks in total, and
their opponents break 7 times in total.

## 6) End of the match

a. Record how match games each team has won at the bottom of the score sheet (it
should total 15).

b. Winning captains take responsibility for taking a photo of the sheet and either post on
Facebook or send to the captains WhatsApp group before 10am the following day.
